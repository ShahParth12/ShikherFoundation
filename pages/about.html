                    <p>Shikher foundation’s journey began with the initiative &quot;Say No to Plastic Bags&quot; in early 2010 in remembering to 26 July water logging witnessing due to the excessive amount plastic bags used in our day-to-day life and recycling was inactive in Mumbai. We believed that this is not the ideal way to use and throw thing unused because it is harmful to the environment and our health. As eco-friendly alternatives already exist so, we initiated the cloth bags making project in underprivileged locality to surplus their income, targeting creative house wife and unemployed youth. It was an innovative initiative to sensitize and educate the society towards recycling everything for environmental protection and improvement with collecting old clothes, books etc... which are unused in their everyday lives and can be useful to someone.<br /><br />The passion to reduce pollution and support unemployment mega projects in rural areas and mass recycling units. With the realization that innovation is needed in the Recycling field to respond to the need for nature in our urbanizing cities. Shikher foundation started with collection of unwanted things within few societies and today continue to collect in Mumbai suburbs.<br /><br />We continue to involve communities, raise awareness, and encourage implementation on the ground, ultimately working together to create a healthy and pollution-free India.<br /><br />We at Shikher Foundation have group of women from rural as well as urban areas that have made many products out of old clothes and papers received in the form of donation which has helped them to earn supplement Income.</p>
